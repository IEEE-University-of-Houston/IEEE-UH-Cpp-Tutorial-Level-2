     * Pointers can be a difficult concept to grasp because it's a
     * little harder to visualize what's going on. Pointers hold the
     * address of a value or another variable, so it's easy to 
     * manipulate values in different places in your code. 
     * Instead of telling it the variable and the computer
     * looks for the variable address and then the value, you can
     * tell it the address and it know exactly where to look in the
     * memory. You can pass variable by reference into functions so
     * you can just use the variable you want to change as an 
     * argument rather than returning another value. Pointers are
     * also used to create and navigate arrays(you've seen the before)
     * and they are used to dynamically allocate memory meaning you
     * can take a certain amount of memory when the code is running
     * rather than a predetermined value at compilation.
