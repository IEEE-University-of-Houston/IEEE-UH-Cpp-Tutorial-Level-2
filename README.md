# C++ Tutorial (Level 2)
This tutorial is a full walkthrough of C++ starting from the main functions and includes. The way that this tutorial is 
setup to run each .cpp file in a compiler of your choice. Below will be some ways to compile these files, and each file 
will have a little description to explain what you are getting into. 

## Compilers
There are a few options with compiling being online or a downloaded compiler. 

Recommended for beginners: Dev C++
<br/>Dev C++ is a basic compiler that is easy to setup, use, and navigate. Here is the link to download: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

For more experienced programmers: Visual Studio 2019
The installation is a little more difficult and up keep is harder too, but it has builtin shortcuts
and looks nicer than Dev C++.
Here is the link to download(get the free version): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

If you do not want to download or cannot download a compiler there are online options. To do this, you have to download the .cpp file and open it in notepad or open the code in GitHub. Copy and paste it into the compiler and press "Run"

Here are some websites that have online compilers:
<br/>-OnlineGDB https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
<br/>-CodeChef(Make sure it's set to C++) https://www.codechef.com/ide 
<br/>-C++ Shell http://cpp.sh/

1. Hello World and Basics
2. Data Types
3. Operators and Precedence
4. If statements and Loops
5. Inputs and Arrays (In progress)
